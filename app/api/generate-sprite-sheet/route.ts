const WALK_SPRITE_PROMPT = `Create a 4-frame pixel art walk cycle sprite sheet of this character.

Arrange the 4 frames in a 2x2 grid on white background. The character is walking to the right.

Top row (frames 1-2):
Frame 1 (top-left): Right leg forward, left leg back - stride position
Frame 2 (top-right): Legs close together, passing/crossing - transition

Bottom row (frames 3-4):
Frame 3 (bottom-left): Left leg forward, right leg back - opposite stride
Frame 4 (bottom-right): Legs close together, passing/crossing - transition back

Each frame shows a different phase of the walking motion. This creates a smooth looping walk cycle.

Use detailed 32-bit pixel art style with proper shading and highlights. Same character design in all frames. Character facing right.`;

const JUMP_SPRITE_PROMPT = `Create a 4-frame pixel art jump animation sprite sheet of this character.

Arrange the 4 frames in a 2x2 grid on white background. The character is jumping.

Top row (frames 1-2):
Frame 1 (top-left): Crouch/anticipation - character slightly crouched, knees bent, preparing to jump
Frame 2 (top-right): Rising - character in air, legs tucked up, arms up, ascending

Bottom row (frames 3-4):
Frame 3 (bottom-left): Apex/peak - character at highest point of jump, body stretched or tucked
Frame 4 (bottom-right): Landing - character landing, slight crouch to absorb impact

Use detailed 32-bit pixel art style with proper shading and highlights. Same character design in all frames. Character facing right.`;

const ATTACK_SPRITE_PROMPT = `Create a 4-frame pixel art attack animation sprite sheet of this character.

Arrange the 4 frames in a 2x2 grid on white background. The character is performing an attack that fits their design - could be a sword slash, magic spell, punch, kick, or energy blast depending on what suits the character best.

Top row (frames 1-2):
Frame 1 (top-left): Wind-up/anticipation - character preparing to attack, pulling back weapon or gathering energy
Frame 2 (top-right): Attack in motion - the strike or spell being unleashed

Bottom row (frames 3-4):
Frame 3 (bottom-left): Impact/peak - maximum extension of attack, weapon fully swung or spell at full power
Frame 4 (bottom-right): Recovery - returning to ready stance

Use detailed 32-bit pixel art style with proper shading and highlights. Same character design in all frames. Character facing right. Make the attack visually dynamic and exciting.`;

const IDLE_SPRITE_PROMPT = `Create a 4-frame pixel art idle/breathing animation sprite sheet of this character.

Arrange the 4 frames in a 2x2 grid on white background. The character is standing still but with subtle idle animation.

Top row (frames 1-2):
Frame 1 (top-left): Neutral standing pose - relaxed stance
Frame 2 (top-right): Slight inhale - chest/body rises subtly, maybe slight arm movement

Bottom row (frames 3-4):
Frame 3 (bottom-left): Full breath - slight upward posture
Frame 4 (bottom-right): Exhale - returning to neutral, slight settle

Keep movements SUBTLE - this is a gentle breathing/idle loop, not dramatic motion. Character should look alive but relaxed.

Use detailed 32-bit pixel art style with proper shading and highlights. Same character design in all frames. Character facing right.`;

const HURT_SPRITE_PROMPT = `Create a 4-frame pixel art TAKE DAMAGE reaction sprite sheet of this character for a side-scrolling game.

Arrange the 4 frames in a clean 2x2 grid on a perfectly flat white background. Keep the character facing RIGHT in every frame.

Frame 1: first contact and a sharp flinch.
Frame 2: torso recoils backward from the hit.
Frame 3: maximum hit-stun pose with a readable silhouette.
Frame 4: beginning to recover toward the normal stance.

Do not show an attacker, weapon, blood, text, UI, floor, or scenery. Preserve the exact character design, proportions, equipment, and pixel-art style. Use detailed polished 32-bit pixel art.`;

const KNOCKDOWN_SPRITE_PROMPT = `Create a 4-frame pixel art KNOCKDOWN reaction sprite sheet of this character for a side-scrolling game.

Arrange the 4 frames in a clean 2x2 grid on a perfectly flat white background. Keep the character oriented toward the RIGHT.

Frame 1: heavy impact sends the character off balance.
Frame 2: falling backward or downward.
Frame 3: grounded knockdown pose.
Frame 4: first recovery movement while still close to the ground.

Do not show an attacker, weapon, blood, text, UI, floor, or scenery. Preserve the exact character design and make every pose fit fully inside its cell. Use detailed polished 32-bit pixel art.`;

const WALK_DOWN_SPRITE_PROMPT = `Create a 4-frame pixel art walk cycle sprite sheet of this character walking DOWNWARD (toward the camera) in a top-down isometric RPG perspective (3/4 overhead view, like a classic top-down RPG).

Arrange the 4 frames in a 2x2 grid on white background. The character is walking toward the viewer (south/down).

Top row (frames 1-2):
Frame 1 (top-left): Left foot forward stride, arms swinging naturally
Frame 2 (top-right): Feet together, passing/transition pose

Bottom row (frames 3-4):
Frame 3 (bottom-left): Right foot forward stride, arms swinging naturally
Frame 4 (bottom-right): Feet together, passing/transition back

We see the character's front/face. Top-down 3/4 view - we see the top of their head slightly. This creates a smooth looping walk cycle.

Use detailed 32-bit pixel art style with proper shading and highlights. Same character design in all frames.`;

const WALK_UP_SPRITE_PROMPT = `Create a 4-frame pixel art walk cycle sprite sheet of this character walking UPWARD (away from the camera) in a top-down isometric RPG perspective (3/4 overhead view, like a classic top-down RPG).

Arrange the 4 frames in a 2x2 grid on white background. The character is walking away from the viewer (north/up).

Top row (frames 1-2):
Frame 1 (top-left): Left foot forward stride, arms swinging naturally — BACK VIEW
Frame 2 (top-right): Feet together, passing/transition pose — BACK VIEW

Bottom row (frames 3-4):
Frame 3 (bottom-left): Right foot forward stride, arms swinging naturally — BACK VIEW
Frame 4 (bottom-right): Feet together, passing/transition back — BACK VIEW

CRITICAL: ALL 4 frames must show the character from EXACTLY the same angle — their BACK, facing directly away from the camera. Do NOT rotate or twist the character between frames. The ONLY difference between frames should be the leg and arm positions for the walk cycle. The character's body angle, head direction, and facing must be IDENTICAL in every frame — always showing the back of the character. A simple back view with only legs alternating.

Use detailed 32-bit pixel art style with proper shading and highlights. Same character design in all frames.`;
